# air-ace-unity
A simple shoot'em up game made during learning Unity3D - it was **my first game created using Unity3D**.
The project was orignally created using **Unity 5.5.0f3**. At the beginning of 2022 I found it on my hard drive, opened it and updated to be run using version 2020.3.20f1.

## What is Air Ace?
The Air Ace project is a simple endless shoot'em up game. Your mission is to shot down all enemy airplanes. But be aware - they shoot you back :) 
The game has a simple online leaderboard system. The result is sent to the server after finishing the game. Additionally, the newest leaderboard is retrived from the server to be displayed in the game.
Unfortunately, the PHP scripts to handle the online leaderboard are missing, so this functionality is currently disabled in the project.

## Graphics
The game was made using free sprites found somewhere in the Internet. 
Today, I have found that this sprites are still available as a part of [SpriteLib](https://www.widgetworx.com/projects/sl.html) relased under Common Public License Version 1.0.

## Audio
There is no audio in this project.
